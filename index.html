                    <p>They say distance makes the heart grow fonder, and every day apart from you proves that to be true. Four months ago, on a day I’ll carry with me forever, everything quietly began to change. Since then, every sunrise feels incomplete without you, every night ends with your name resting gently in my thoughts.</p>
                    
                    <p>I built this little corner of the internet just for you — a place where miles don't matter, where time zones fade away, and where it's just us. Every word here, every color, every heartbeat... it's all for you, babygirl.</p>
                    
                    <p>You've made me believe in love that transcends distance, in connections that run deeper than any physical space. You've shown me what it means to miss someone so much it hurts, and to love someone so much it heals.</p>
                    
                    <p>This Valentine's Day, even though I can't hold your hand, I'm holding you in every thought, every breath, every moment.</p>
